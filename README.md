# o1graph
Using LangGraph to create o1-like reasoning chains.

This is an early prototype of using prompting to create o1-like reasoning chains to improve LLM output accuracy. It is not perfect and accuracy has yet to be formally evaluated.

Inspired by the [groq-g1 project](https://github.com/bklieger-groq/g1).
